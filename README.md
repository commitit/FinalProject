# Question Classification Using Transformers and LLM-based QA system

### Project Overview

This project, conducted as part of the Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS) in Advanced Machine Learning program at the University of Bern, focuses on enhancing the customer service experience at GS Bank, a hypothetical financial institution, through advanced question classification techniques. In the banking and finance sector, accurately categorizing customer inquiries is essential for improving response times, increasing customer satisfaction, and streamlining support processes.

Our research leverages pre-trained transformer models to classify client questions into specific categories such as Accounts, Cards, Insurance, and Loans. By automating this classification process, we aim to provide valuable insights into customer needs and optimize the bank's product offerings accordingly. Additionally, this study explores the integration of a retrieval-based Question Answering (QA) system using a Large Language Model (LLM) to further enhance the bank's responsiveness to client queries. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining machine learning models with practical banking applications to significantly improve customer support and product optimization strategies.
